# Uber-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover insights into travel behavior, focusing on differences between business and personal rides. Using Python, the raw dataset was cleaned and enriched with features such as trip duration, weekday, and time-of-day. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed ride patterns by category, purpose, and time trends
